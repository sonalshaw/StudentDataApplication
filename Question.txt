Let's create a project called "Student Management System" using the provided topics. This system will allow users to manage student records, including adding new students, viewing student information, updating student details, and deleting students. We'll use various Python concepts such as functions, lists, dictionaries, file handling, and exception handling to implement this project.

    Here's a detailed breakdown of the project:
        1. Variables and Data Types:
            We'll use variables to store student information such as name, age, grade, etc.
            Data types like strings, integers, and lists will be used to represent different aspects of student records.
        2. Basic Input and Output (I/O):
            We'll use input() function to get user input for various operations.
            Output will be displayed using print() function to show the results of operations.
        3. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):
            Conditional statements will be used for validation, such as checking if a student exists before updating or deleting their record.
        4. Loops (for loops, while loops):
            Loops will be used for iterating through student records, displaying options repeatedly until the user decides to exit the program.
        5. Lists and Tuples:
            We'll use lists to store multiple student records and tuples to represent individual student information.
        6. Dictionaries:
            Dictionaries will be used to represent student records, with student IDs as keys and details as values.
        7. Functions:
            Functions will be defined for various operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records.
        8. Modules and Packages:
            We can organize our code into modules and packages for better structure and reusability.
        9. File Handling:
            We'll use file handling to store student records persistently in a text file, allowing data to be saved and loaded between program runs.
        10. Exception Handling:
            We'll handle exceptions to deal with potential errors, such as file not found or invalid user input.
        11. User-Defined Exceptions:
            We can define custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios, such as student not found or duplicate student ID.

    The project will include functionalities such as:
        => Adding a new student record.
        => Viewing student information.
        => Updating student details.
        => Deleting a student record.
        => Saving student records to a file.
        => Loading student records from a file.
